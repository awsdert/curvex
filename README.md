Curve math that avoids PI &amp; Trigonometry

## About
I recently developed a bignum math library and originally was thinking how to include PI in it given that PI needs to be calculated to be accurate in all cases, I later came to the realisation that for me this would for the time being be impossible (the library in question is my alu repository). I then started thinking about ways to draw circles without PI, that led me onto trigonometry, of which I subsequently ignored aftered noticing something very important about how dotted circles are drawn for the same math will apply to solid circles and even ovals and spheres, I noticed that the dots are always just a portion of the radius, this lead me down the route of calculating the percentage of difference between each point if they where on a flat line, the y and z axis simply build upon that their own percentage, right now I only have the math for drawing a circle put together as I was only a experimenting over the last few days, I will be cleaning up that code and putting a more complete &amp; presentable form prior to uploading today. As for the license I think I will be modifying it because I want sold products that utilise it to pay 1% of their sale fee to me, research would instead pay a fixed fee that I'm currently undecided about, though I'm currently thinking that Â£10 per month should be fine if I consider all the potential places in the world that could be wanting to utilise it.
